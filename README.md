## Forking a project

If you want a local copy, clone this repo using git, then run `npm install` (or similar command for another package managers) to install dependencies.

## Developing

Once you've got everything installed, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

Application builds using "static" adapter: you will get a bunch of static files which you can serve using any provider of your choice. Server-side rendering is disabled.
