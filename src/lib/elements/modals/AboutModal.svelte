    <p>
      This page offers a way to play AI-generated text-based games which would include real-time
      Twitch chat messages. Chat interaction becomes an important part of these games.
    </p>

    <p>
      Chat messages are sent alongside your prompts into
      <a href="https://chat.openai.com" target="_blank">OpenAI's ChatGPT</a>, and the model is asked
      to analyze the chat logs and make use of whatever is being sent.
    </p>

    <p>
      You will need to provide your own OpenAI API key, since there is no other way to authorize
      yet. Additionally, you have to specify a Twitch channel's name to read the chat from.
    </p>

    <p>
      The source code for this application is available at
      <a href="https://github.com/g7eternal/openai-dnd" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
